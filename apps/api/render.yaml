# Render Build Configuration
# This file tells Render how to build and run your API

# Build Command (run from repository root)
# yarn install && cd apps/api && yarn build

# Start Command (run from repository root)
# cd apps/api && yarn start

# Or if you want to use the monorepo structure:
# Build: yarn workspace api build
# Start: yarn workspace api start
